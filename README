Note :- This programme was initially written to make life easier and prevent myself from doing the hectic search for available books in IIITA library.
	Now it has been modified to fulfill many requirements.This programme has various scope and it can be used in many ways.
	It can be used for search in multiple fields instead of just doing search in 'title' or 'author' or 'accno' etc. Eg :- one can use this programme to
	search for any book that is a book of networking and written by stevens."manfile.txt" has detailed description of how to use this programme.
	It can be modified in many ways to make good use of it.	Any suggestion and useful modification is always welcome.
	
--WARNING--
You are not allowed to use this programme for any hack (unethical) purpose (But to do that you will have to figure it out).You are responsible for your own deeds.
